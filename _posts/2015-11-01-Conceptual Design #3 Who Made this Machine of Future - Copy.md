title: Future Biomolecular Analyse Machine #Design&Visual
---

This is a model from one of our instrument automation proposal. A microfluidic dispenser that deposit liquid drops in nano-liter scale is highlighted in blue, with actuators in yellow and polymer microfluidic consumables in pink. The idea is to incorporate our piece of dispenser tightly with a microscope to facilitate biomolecular research. 
I built it in 3Dmax and rendered it with Keyshot toolbox.
