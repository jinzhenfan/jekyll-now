title: How green and clean is your salmon? #Design&Visual
---

Antibiotic overdoes has casued millions of infant death in Asia. The contamination source come from additive antibiotics in the feeding of live stocks, seafood, and vegetables. Although FDA has a regulation limit for antibiotic level in agricultural products, it is still possible that the food below the FDA limit levels that causes antimicrobial resistance through long term chronic exposure. People are more and more concerned about food safety for their family.

This is a conceptual design of a antibiotic detection chip for your everyday food. We actually made it into an actual prototype with the technology of novel extracting, nanofibers and nanoprinting, magnifying the signal to a visually readable level. The idea is to get visual, instant, accurate antibiotic indexed on the chip simply with a piece of raw meat inserted into the syringes. As a matter of fact, we tested with salmon from Safeway and WholeFoods, and found the antibiotic level in the former one is detectable as 0.1 parts per billion, while nothing is detectable from the latter. when you see price differences of salmon from WholeFoods and Safeway, you will know some reasons. I built it in 3Dmax and rendered it with Keyshot toolbox.
