title: Gene Regulatory Network Inference based on Random Forests
category: analysis
---

In this blog, I will build a gene regulatory network from gene expression data using Random Forests and perform a functional analysis for that network. 

### Datasets

I use a dataset from a microarray experiment of Escherichia coli K-12 strain to investigate biofilm formation in the first 24 hours of the culture. 

The paper that describes this experiment is the following:
Domka J, Lee J, Bansal T, Wood TK. Temporal gene-expression in Escherichia coli K-12 biofilms. Environ Microbiol. 2007 Feb;9(2):332-46.
And you can download it from:
[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17222132](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17222132)

### Random Forests

The paper that describes how this method work has been published in PLoS One in 2010 and can be viewed here:
