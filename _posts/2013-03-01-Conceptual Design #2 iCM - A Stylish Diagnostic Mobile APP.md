title: A taste of Chinese Ink Paiting Style 
---

One day my advisor had this idea of developing a online real-time machine diagnostic APP working with someone in China. For all kinds of reasons, I was part of it. 

I did the design work in Photoshop, which I particularly like because of the Chinese Ink Paiting Style.

As a matter of fact, users can get their heartrate, pulses, health conditions by taky videos of themselves for a few seconds. We corrected the error of illumination, and use picture pattern recognition algorithms trained by real cases to generate the output data.
