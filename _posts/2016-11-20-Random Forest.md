Which genes are dominating when bacteria are trying to from a film? In this blog, I will build a gene regulatory network from E.Coli gene expression data during biofilm formation, using a method based on Random Forests, and perform a functional analysis for that network. 

### Background

Biofilms are a community of microorganisms attached to a surface by polysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids. E. coli biofilm development is a complex process that leads to beautiful structures that are important for disease and for engineering applications. It remains a question that what genes are dominating when bacteria are trying to from a film? $^1$
