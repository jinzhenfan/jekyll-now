Due to the complexity of genomic datasets, the best approach to analyze data is often not clear from the beginning. In fact, several approaches and tools exist for analysis of most genomic datasets. Each approach is optimized and validated for specific datasets and may not be applicable across the board. However, due to lack of clear guidelines on when to use or not use an approach, data analysis teams sometimes end up taking suboptimal or even inapplicable approaches. This can lead to contradictory results between different studies on the same subjects. Such contradictions have to be resolved by careful examination of considerations/assumptions that may have motivated an approach.
