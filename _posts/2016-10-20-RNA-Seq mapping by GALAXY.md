title: RNA-Seq Mapping by GALAXY
category: analysis
---

For this exercise, you will use a software suite that is called GALAXY to analyze five RNA-Seq datasets. The datasets are paired-end 50bp reads from adrenal and brain tissues (500Kb region of chromosome 19, chr19:3000000:3500000). You can find the datasets and tutorial [here](https://usegalaxy.org/u/jeremy/p/galaxy-rna-seq-analysis-exercise). The datasets contain the transcriptional profiles in those tissues and our task is to find genes that are differentially expressed (DEG) in the sample conditions versus the control sample. We have 3 programs to perform this task: edgeR, Cuffdiff and DESeq2. You are asked to do this analysis with each and finally report the results.
